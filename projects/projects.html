	<h1>Group Project:</h1>
	<p>
		The objective of the group project is to be able to experience the workflow of working on a codebase 
		in a small team. You should make a brief plan of what you want to build, ideally write down some ideas 
		for layout on the whiteboard or paper to formulate a plan to break up who works on what page and who 
		will commit the beginning of the project.
	</p>
	<p>
		A few ideas I suggest you choose from are the following.  If you would like to pick another idea for 
		the group project run it by me and I will give ita go ahead or not depending on complexity.

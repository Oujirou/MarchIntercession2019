	<h2 class="center">New App Releases</h2>
	<p class="justify">Leading up to my winter break was a series of fires that were going on due to us trying to release a new version of our mobile games at Playstudios.  
					   First I was working on my primary title myVegas where we broke a record for releases in a single week due to finding edge cases in production that
					   were serious enough to justify hotfixing before the Apple Winter cutoff date.  When not working on myVegas I was assisting our Konami team out in 
					   Austin that was having issues upgrading to Unity 2018 that ended up needing a lot more time from myself than I would have anticipated.  we had not 
					   realized this was an issue until we visited Austin for an unrelated business trip that turned into spending half the time there getting the Konami 
					   team's build system up and running again - fun times.</p>

			A few items I worked on over the break were painting a cabinet that I had only half way finished due to having a bunch of kids around 
			the house that really wanted to help out in painting.  It took a few late nights after the kids went to sleep to apply a few coats of paint but I got to continue 
			the story line in Final Fantasy 14 Stormblood while I was waiting so that was alright with me.
			</p>
			<p class="justify">
			Aside from painting furniture I mounted our new TV we got on a Black Friday sale along with a new Sound Bar and reworked all my cord management so everything
			didn't look like a hot mess.  I also added another SSD into my desktop since I was hitting my limits between Steam and Battle.net installs and needed to get around that.

			While I picked up the Final Fantasy 14 expansion Stormblood when it launched I ended up getting sucked out of gaming entirely due to work and life.  This break I finally 
			went about getting back into the game to move forward the story since the next expansion, Shadowbringers, it planned out this summer.  Depending on when World of Warcraft 
			classic launches I plan on playing it when it comes out so I need to advance the story and hit level 70 sooner than later.  On the PC aside from playing FF14 I also played 
			a little Escape from Tarkov, BATTLETECH, and Darkest Dungeon.

			For Christmas I picked up a Nintendo Switch to be able to play some games with the young kids while also having a few party games handy.  I picked up Mario Odyssey, Mario 
			Kart 8, Smash Brothers, and Zelda.  I played a little of each, but mostly stuck to playing Zelda since I find it a bit more enjoyable and challenging that Mario.  I'm still 
			woefully lacking new characters for Smash Bros and haven't really put time into unlockig any extras, I'll worry about that eventually...

			I finally got caught up on a number of series' that I've been watching here and there with my personal favorite being Goblin Slayer.  Thankfully it turns out that the series 
			won't be ending and will be picked up for another season sometime in the future.  Aside from that I also got caught up on Attack on Titan season 3, That Time I Was Reincarnated 
			as a Slime (seriously), A Certain Magical Index, and Overlord.  I've also been watching the latest Sword Art Online: Aliciazation, which has surprisingly not been total garbage, 
			but the first half of SAO season 1 was good and turned into a dumpster fire so we'll see how it lasts as it enters the second half.
			</p>
			<p class="justify">
			The new season of anime is already starting back up with SAO continuing and a new Mob Psycho 100, aside from that nothing really striked my fancy series wise.  I know there is a 
			Code Geass movie that's due out this year which would be fun to watch but I'm not entirely sure where to legitimately watch that...

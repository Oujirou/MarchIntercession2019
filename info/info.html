	<h1 class="center">Intro to Cover Letters</h1>
	<p class="justify">
		The objective of a cover letter is to write about how you will fit for a specific role and how you stand out from others. As the cover letter is 
		going to be attached with your Resume you should not be duplicating information in your resume in your cover letter, but you can provide context 
		and personality to make points in your resume stand out.

	<h1 class="center">Intro to Post Mortems</h1>
	<p class="justify">
		A Post Mortem is an excersise where a team comes together to evaluate how a project, release, or feature went for purposes of improvement.  A 
		Post Mortem is a blameless excersise and focuses on a few main points:
	</p>
	<br/>
	<ul>
		<li>What went right?</li>
		<li>What went wrong?</li>
		<li>How can we improve for next time?</li>
	</ul>
	<br/>
	<p class="justify">
		By the end you should have a google doc that addresses each of these points with at least one entry in each category with any feedback the team 
		would like to contribute.

	<h1 class="center">JavaScript Examples</h1>
	<!-- Here is where we import our JS File for use in the next section. -->
	<script src="scripts/examples.js"></script>
	<!-- 
		A button uses onclick as a handler you can define logic for.  What is written inside is Javascript code.
		document -> The current HTML Document.
		getElementById -> A method, or function, that an HTML document has. It allows us to get an HTML tag we defined to perform logic upon.
			(https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_document_getelementbyid.asp)
		innerHTML -> What value is contained inside the HTML tags.  In this case it begins with the value "Uninitialized".
		randomOutput -> This is the method, or function, that is defined in the scripts/examples.js file.
	-->
	<button type="button" 
		onclick="document.getElementById('demo').innerHTML = randomOutput()">
		Click to run JS Code.</button>
	<p id="demo">Uninitialized</p>

	<button type="button" 
		onclick="adjustHealth(1)">
		Add Health.</button>
	<button type="button" 
		onclick="adjustHealth(-1)">
		Remove Health.</button>

	<br/>
	<p class="justify">
		Among the many advancements in technology that has allowed us to deliver content on the web one of the greatest assets has been CDNs.  A CDN 
		allows us to dramatically increase the speed in which content can be downloaded by requiring less physical distance in which data has to travel.
